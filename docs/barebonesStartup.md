# Barebones Startup Plan for Whisper WebUI-centric AI Assistant

This document outlines a simplified approach to starting the Whisper WebUI-centric AI Assistant project, leveraging the existing whisper-webui project and integrating it with Rivet for AI response generation.

## 1. Whisper WebUI Integration
- Clone the whisper-webui repository into the project folder
- Set up the required environment for whisper-webui (Python, dependencies)
- Familiarize with the existing features:
  - Transcription from YouTube videos, audio/video files, and microphone recordings
  - Multiple output formats (plain text, SRT, VTT)
  - GPU acceleration support
  - Multiple whisper model support

(Reference: Original Phase 2 for full Whisper setup and integration)

## 2. Backend Setup for AI Response Generation
- Set up a lightweight Node.js server with Express.js
- Implement API endpoints to receive transcription data from whisper-webui
- Integrate Rivet for AI workflow management
- Implement basic prompt-response functionality using Rivet

(Reference: Original Phase 4 for full backend development and API integration)

## 3. Frontend Enhancements
- Modify the existing whisper-webui frontend to send transcription data to our backend
- Add a simple interface for displaying AI-generated responses
- Implement basic error handling and loading states

(Reference: Original Phase 3 for full frontend development)

## 4. Simple Deployment
- Deploy on a single server (e.g., DigitalOcean Droplet)
- Set up nginx to serve both the whisper-webui frontend and our Node.js backend
- Implement a basic deployment process

(Reference: Original Phase 7 for full deployment and maintenance procedures)

## 5. Essential Security Measures
- Implement basic authentication if required
- Set up HTTPS using Let's Encrypt
- Configure basic firewall rules

(Reference: Original Phase 7 for comprehensive security setup)

## 6. Minimal Testing
- Perform manual testing of the integrated system
- Implement basic error logging

(Reference: Original Phase 5 for comprehensive testing and quality assurance)

## 7. Basic Documentation
- Create a README.md with setup and usage instructions
- Document the integration between whisper-webui and the AI response generation backend

(Reference: Original Phase 8 for full documentation guidelines)

## Next Steps
After implementing this barebones version:
1. Gather user feedback on the integrated system
2. Identify priority features for enhancement
3. Gradually implement more advanced Rivet workflows
4. Optimize the interaction between whisper-webui and the AI response generation
5. Expand the frontend capabilities as needed
6. Implement more robust infrastructure and deployment processes

Remember to refer back to the original project phases for guidance on full deployment and advanced feature implementation as the project evolves.
